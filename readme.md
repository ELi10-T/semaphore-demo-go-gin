Repository used : [Go-Gin Website](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/building-go-web-applications-and-microservices-using-gin)

Gin is a high performance micro framework which is used
in building web applications and microservices.

It is simple to use and can resuse particular parts of modular code into existing request handlers by creating middlewares and grouping them into one or more or to a group of request handlers.

> This is the crux of what Gin offers. It contains a set of commonly used functionalities, e.g. routing, middleware support, rendering, that reduce boilerplate code and make writing web applications simpler.

> Basic flow of gin - Request => Router Parser => Middleware (Optional) => Handler => Middleware(Optional) => Response
